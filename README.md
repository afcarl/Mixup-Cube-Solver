Notation
========

Here are the usual Rubik's cube 90 degree turns. By default, they are clockwise
turns. Adding an apostrophe ('), pronounced "prime", means a counter-clockwise
turn. Adding a 2 after means a 180 degree turn. These letters also identify the
6 faces of the cube.
* L - Left
* R - Right
* U - Up
* D - Down
* F - Front
* B - Back

Here are the slice moves of the Mixup Cube. They are all 45 degree turns, moving pieces from edge slots to face slots and vice versa.
* M - Middle - Move the slice between L and R faces. The top comes towards the front face. The cubie in the UF slot will now be in the F slot.
* E - Equator - Move the slice between U and D faces. The left comes towards the front face. The cubie in the FL slot will now be in the F slot.
* S - Standing - Move the slice between F and B faces. The top comes towards the right face. The cubie in the UR slot will now be in the R slot.
